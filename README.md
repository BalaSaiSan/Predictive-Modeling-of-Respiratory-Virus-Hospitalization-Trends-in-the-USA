# Predictive Modeling of Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Trends in the USA
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected global health systems all over the world.
Accurate forecasting of hospitalizations is essential for effective resource allocation and management of the healthcare system.

## Why We Choose This Project?
This project was chosen to improve how health resources are allocated and managed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Accurate forecasting of hospitalizations is essential for optimizing resource allocation and enhancing preparedness and response strategies.

## Goal of This Project
The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations using data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the website cdc.gov
By doing so, the project aims to help healthcare systems in the United States allocate resources more effectively and manage healthcare services more efficiently during the pandemic.
This will ultimately improve health outcomes and reduce the impact of the pandemic in the future.

## Conclusion 
Insightful Patterns Identified: Our models have identified that age and pre-existing health conditions are significant predictors of hospitalization due to respiratory viruses. Seasonal trends also play a crucial role, with spikes in hospitalizations typically occurring in the winter months.
Geographical Variations: There are notable differences in hospitalization rates across different states, indicating that local health policies and population density may influence these trends.
Resource Allocation: Our models can inform health authorities about potential spikes in hospitalizations, allowing for better resource allocation, such as beds and medical staff.
Policy Formulation: Insights from the models can guide public health policies, particularly in vaccination drives and public health advisories.
